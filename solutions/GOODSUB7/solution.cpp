 * Problem Analysis:
 * A sequence is "good" if the parity of adjacent elements is different.
 * This means the sequence must alternate between odd and even numbers.
 * To find the longest good subsequence, we simply need to pick elements 
 * such that we alternate between odd and even.
 * 
 * We can greedily pick the first element, then look for the next element 
 * with a different parity, and so on.
